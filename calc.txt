[1.28] in this video i'm going to attempt to [3.28] teach [4.16] the fundamentals of calculus in a very [6.319] short time [8.4] so there's three areas of calculus that [10.88] you want to be familiar with the first [12.96] one [14.24] is limits [16.8] now limits help you to evaluate a [19.52] function [21.199] let's say if we want to evaluate [24.64] f when x is equal to 2 but for some [27.359] reason a function is undefined or we [29.439] just can't do it [30.8] well a limit will allow you [33.68] to see what happens as x approaches 2. [38.32] and so limits are very useful [40.559] to find out what happens to a function [42.32] as we approach a certain value [45.28] now the second area of calculus that you [47.2] want to know [48.559] is derivatives [51.36] so what are derivatives well basically [54.0] derivatives are functions [56.48] that give you the slope of an original [59.68] function at some value [62.16] so let's say if i have some function f [64.72] of x [66.0] the derivative of f of x is known as f [68.159] prime of x [69.68] now this function here will tell me the [73.119] slope of this function [75.04] at some x value [77.119] it will give me the slope of the tangent [78.64] line [79.84] so derivatives [81.36] are very useful for calculating rates of [83.759] change [85.2] now the third area is integration [89.52] integration is basically the opposite [92.079] of [92.88] derivatives [94.799] with integration you're basically [96.24] finding the area under the curve [101.04] integration is very useful for [102.88] calculating [104.24] how much something accumulates over time [107.52] and what you need to know is that [108.72] derivatives and integration [110.799] they're opposites of each other for [112.56] instance [114.24] we said that the derivative of the [116.24] function f of x [117.92] is equal to f prime of x [121.6] so this is the derivative [124.079] of the original function f [128.08] integral [129.119] of f prime of x [131.68] is f of x [134.16] so this [135.92] is the antiderivative or [138.72] the integral of f [140.84] prime [142.8] so you can think of integration as [145.2] finding the anti-derivative [149.04] now let's begin our discussion with [151.04] limits [152.4] so let's say that [154.959] f of x [157.519] is x squared minus oh that is a terrible [159.92] looking two let me do that again so [161.76] let's say it's x squared minus four [164.08] over x minus two [168.319] what is [169.76] f of two [171.68] can we evaluate the function [173.92] at x equals two well let's find out so [176.72] if we plug in two [179.519] two squared is four four minus four is [181.68] zero [182.72] and 0 over 0 what is that [185.44] well we can't figure this thing out so [186.959] that's indeterminate [188.48] therefore we can't [190.0] evaluate the function [191.84] at x equals 2. and so this is when [194.0] limits become important [196.159] so if we can't find out the value of the [198.0] function when x is 2 [200.159] can we find out [201.92] what the function will do [203.68] as x approaches 2. [209.2] so what happens [211.04] when [213.2] x is let's say 2.1 [220.159] so if we were to plug in 2.1 into the [222.319] function [228.879] you should get [231.92] 4.1 [234.64] now what if we plug in a number that's [236.64] even closer to 2 [238.4] let's say 2.01 [243.599] well if we do that [245.68] this will give us 4.01 [248.4] so notice that as x gets closer and [252.0] closer to 2 [254.4] the value of the function [256.239] gets closer and closer to 4. [260.0] so thus we can use a limit expression [265.919] so we could say that the limit as x [268.479] approaches two [270.16] of x squared minus four over x minus two [273.44] we know it's equal to four but to show [275.52] your work [276.8] what you need to do is factor x squared [278.8] minus four [280.639] and when you factor it using the [281.919] difference of squares method it's x plus [284.56] 2 minus i mean times x minus 2. [288.0] and so we could cancel this factor [291.6] and so we're left with the limit as x [294.08] approaches 2 [295.6] of x plus two so now we can use direct [297.84] substitution [299.28] so we can replace [301.28] x with two so this becomes two plus two [305.28] and this gives us the limit which is [306.72] four [307.919] so this tells us that as x gets closer [310.88] and closer to two [312.96] the y value or f of x will approach a [316.16] value of four [318.4] so even though [319.68] f of two [321.039] does not exist [323.36] the limit [324.56] as x approaches two of the function f of [327.36] x that exists and that's equal to four [330.8] and so make sure you understand that [332.32] limits [333.44] help you [334.8] to see what happens or what happens to a [337.28] function [338.4] as x approaches a certain value [342.32] now let's move on to number two [344.72] derivatives [347.36] so how can we find the derivative of a [349.28] function [351.039] the most basic rule we need to know is [352.72] the power rule [354.0] the derivative [355.44] of a variable raised to a constant [358.56] such as x raised to the n power is n [361.52] x raised to the n minus 1. so how do we [363.84] apply that [365.44] well let's say if we want to find the [367.44] derivative of [368.96] x squared [370.56] so in this case n is 2 [373.759] so it's going to be 2 times x raised to [375.759] the 2 minus 1 or just 1 so we get 2x [380.24] if we want to find the derivative of [382.16] let's say x cubed [384.479] n is 3 so it's going to be 3 [386.479] x to the 3 minus 1 [390.08] which is 3x squared [394.0] now if we want to find the derivative of [395.759] x to the fourth power [397.919] it's going to be 4 [399.759] x raised to the 4 minus 1 [402.16] which is 4 x cubed [404.56] and so that's a simple process [406.72] in which you could find the derivative [408.96] of a function [411.68] but now what does it mean so we said [413.84] that the derivative is a function [416.479] that gives us the slope of the tangent [418.72] line [419.68] of some original function so you might [422.8] be wondering what is a tangent line [426.0] so let's talk about that let's say if we [427.759] have some curve [429.84] and a tangent line [431.759] is a line that touches a curve at one [434.88] point now you need to be familiar with a [437.84] secant line [439.199] a secant line [440.56] is a line that touches a curve [442.88] at two points [446.72] so the slope of a tangent line is equal [449.44] to the derivative of a function [452.24] at some value [454.479] to calculate the slope of a secant line [456.88] you've done this before in algebra using [459.36] this expression [460.96] it's rise over run y2 minus y1 over x2 [465.039] minus x1 [468.639] now let's say that f of x [471.599] is x cubed [473.36] using the power rule the first [475.12] derivative is 3x squared [478.56] so let's say if we wanted to calculate [480.639] the slope of the tangent line [482.639] when x [483.919] is equal to two [486.56] so the slope of the tangent line is [488.24] going to be [490.0] f prime of two which is 3 times 2 [492.8] squared so it's 12. [495.36] so this means that at x equals 2 [498.16] the slope is 12. [500.72] so what does that mean that means that [502.4] as you travel one unit to the right [505.36] the curve will increase [507.599] by a value of 12. [509.84] so every time you travel or every time [511.84] the x value increases by one the y value [514.8] will increase by 12. [516.56] so that's what a slope of 12 means [524.8] now let's draw a rough sketch [528.64] of the original function x cubed now the [531.279] graph doesn't have to be perfect but [534.24] just good enough [535.76] for instructional purposes [538.48] and just to keep things simple let's say [541.36] at this point x is equal to 2. now [543.519] granted the graph is not drawn to scale [545.44] so keep that in mind [548.88] now what we're going to do is we're [550.16] going to estimate the slope of the [552.24] tangent line [555.12] using the slope of the secant line [559.44] now to calculate the slope of the secant [561.12] line you need to choose two points [564.56] a point that's to the left [567.04] of where you want to evaluate the slope [569.44] of the tangent line and one that's to [571.279] the right [573.6] so this point is two we need to choose [576.64] two points [577.839] such that the midpoint of those two [580.08] points is equal to two [582.16] so we can use [583.839] one and three for an example [585.76] we can use [587.04] one point not in 2.1 [589.279] or we could use 1.99 and 2.01 [593.76] in each of those cases [595.519] 2 is the midpoint but we're going to see [598.16] what happens to the slope of the secant [599.92] line [600.959] as the two points [602.959] as they get closer and closer [605.12] to the slope of the tangent line [618.079] so first let's calculate the slope [621.2] on the interval [622.72] from [623.6] one to three [626.88] so we're going to use this formula y2 [628.48] minus y1 over x2 minus x1 [632.8] so y is the same as f of x [636.72] by the way this is x1 and this is x2 so [639.519] x2 is 3 x1 is 1. [642.8] y2 [643.92] is going to be equal to the function [646.48] when x is 3 [648.64] y 1 is equal to the function [650.959] when [651.839] x is 1. [653.92] so basically to evaluate f of 3 we need [656.56] to plug in 3 into that expression [659.04] so this is going to be three to the [660.399] third power and f of one is one to the [662.56] third power [664.399] three to the third is twenty seven one [666.959] cube is one three minus one is two [670.0] so we get twenty six over two which is [672.839] thirteen so this is not a bad [675.279] approximation for the slope of the [677.2] tangent line [678.32] as you can see 12 and 13 [680.64] they're not too far apart [689.04] so i'm just going to write this down on [690.959] the bottom [692.079] for reference [694.399] so now let's choose [696.8] numbers that are closer to 2 like 1.9 [700.72] and 2.1 so 2 is the midpoint [709.36] so it's going to be [710.88] f of 2.1 [713.12] minus f of [714.839] 1.9 over 2.1 [717.68] minus 1.9 [720.32] so let's plug in 2.1 into that [722.0] expression [723.12] so that's going to be 2.1 to the third [724.88] power [725.92] minus 1.9 to the third power [728.32] 2.1 minus 1.9 that's 0.2 [738.24] so if you plug this in [740.079] you should get [741.88] 12.01 [743.76] and notice that this [745.76] is a very good approximation [748.8] to [749.92] the slope of the tangent line so notice [752.079] that the slope of the secant line [754.399] approximates the slope of the tangent [756.16] line [757.519] as [758.48] these values get closer and closer to 2. [763.12] now what was that something [765.519] that helped us [767.279] to evaluate a function [769.519] as x gets closer and closer to some [772.24] value [773.76] if you remember its limits [776.56] so we need to incorporate a limit [778.399] expression [780.0] with [781.36] some sort of rate of change that looks [783.12] like this [785.44] so let's use limits [787.36] to evaluate the slope of the tangent [789.12] line [792.24] so x is going to approach 2 [796.56] and it's going to be f of x [798.88] minus f of two [801.04] over x minus two [805.839] now f of x [807.519] we know it's [809.68] x cubed [811.04] f of two if you plug in two into that [812.959] expression 2 to the third is 8 [816.16] and you get this [817.839] now we need to factor x cubed minus 8. [821.839] so to factor differences of perfect [823.839] cubes [824.959] you could use this formula it's a minus [826.88] b [827.68] times a squared [829.44] plus a b [831.199] plus b squared [832.8] so to factor x cubed minus eight [836.079] x is a b is [838.48] the cube root of eight which is two [840.88] a squared is x squared a b is 2x [844.56] b squared is 4. [846.56] so this is how you can factor x cubed [848.399] minus 8. [854.8] so now we have this [856.399] the limit as x goes to two [860.32] of x minus two [862.72] times x squared plus two x plus four [866.8] over x minus two [870.16] so now these two factors will cancel [875.92] and now [878.0] we can substitute [879.6] 2 with x [880.959] so we have the limit as x approaches two [884.079] of x squared plus two x plus four [887.76] and so becomes [889.44] two squared plus two [893.04] times two [894.399] plus four [895.839] two squared is four two times two is [897.68] four [898.88] and if you add four three times it's the [901.199] same as [902.24] taking four and multiplying it by three [904.399] which gives you twelve [907.36] and so we could use a limit process [910.639] to find the slope of the tangent line [913.92] as well as [915.76] just finding the derivative and plugging [918.079] this in [919.44] so as you can see [921.04] the derivative [923.6] is a function [925.6] that gives us the slope of the tangent [927.76] line at some x value [930.32] and there's multiple ways in which you [931.92] can [932.639] calculate the slope of the tangent line [934.72] you can estimate it [936.32] using the slope of the secant line or [938.56] you can calculate it using a limit [940.24] process [941.6] so i wanted to connect limits with [943.92] derivatives [945.199] in one video [948.72] now the next area is integration [952.16] which is equivalent to [954.0] anti-differentiation [955.92] as we said before it's the process of [957.68] finding the anti-derivative [960.959] now if you recall we said that the [962.32] derivative [963.6] of x to the fourth [966.0] is 4x cubed using the power rule [969.68] well the integral [971.199] of 4 x cubed [973.6] should give us [975.279] x to the fourth [976.88] and here's the formula for finding the [978.8] anti-derivative or the integral [981.519] so you're going to add 1 to n [983.519] and then divide [985.519] by that result [987.68] and you're going to add some constant of [989.519] integration [990.8] the derivative of any constant is 0 so [993.12] when you integrate you always have to [994.56] add a constant to your expression [1001.04] so this is going to be 4 [1003.279] x [1004.32] to the 3 plus 1 divided by 3 plus 1. [1008.079] so that's 4 x to the fourth [1010.48] over four and let's not forget to add [1012.959] plus c [1014.399] and so as you can see [1016.56] we get [1017.839] x to the fourth plus some constant [1021.199] so integration [1022.88] is the opposite process of [1024.64] differentiation so you can call it [1026.64] anti-differentiation [1029.76] now i want to take a minute to compare [1031.76] derivatives [1033.679] and [1034.64] anti-derivatives [1036.319] or integration side by side [1042.079] just so you could see [1043.679] a summary of the key differences between [1046.16] the two [1047.919] so when dealing with derivatives [1050.559] you're looking for a function [1055.36] that will tell you [1057.6] the slope [1059.12] of the tangent line which touches the [1060.88] curve at one point [1063.2] at some [1064.24] x value [1065.52] so derivatives are useful [1067.679] for calculating [1069.28] the instantaneous [1071.44] rate of change [1073.919] now when dealing with integration [1078.88] this will help you to determine [1082.24] how much [1083.44] something accumulates over a period of [1085.679] time [1086.559] whereas derivatives will tell you how [1089.039] fast something changes per unit of time [1093.84] so integration is very useful for [1096.08] calculating [1097.36] the area [1098.559] under the curve [1102.24] so when dealing with derivatives it will [1104.48] give you the slope of the tangent line [1107.039] which you can calculate it by [1109.52] dividing y by x [1112.0] to calculate the area you need to [1114.4] multiply [1116.559] y by x so notice the difference [1120.64] so in its simplest form [1122.88] when you're differentiating [1124.72] you're dividing the y values by the x [1127.2] values [1128.48] whereas when you're integrating you're [1130.559] multiplying the y values by the x values [1133.679] and multiplication and division they're [1135.84] opposite processes and that's [1137.6] essentially what you're doing when [1139.28] you're differentiating and integrating [1141.44] now of course is a little bit more [1142.48] complicated than that but [1144.16] that is the gist of it [1147.039] let's consider this problem [1149.28] so we have a function a of t [1151.919] which is point zero one t squared plus [1154.72] point five t plus a hundred [1156.88] and this function [1158.48] represents the amount of water in [1160.16] gallons that is inside a tank [1163.12] at any time t and t is in minutes [1166.4] so what we need to do is calculate the [1167.919] amount of water [1169.44] at the following times [1172.72] so when t is 0 [1174.96] when it's 9 [1176.64] 10 [1177.76] 11 and 20. [1181.12] so go ahead and do that [1183.2] when you get a chance so feel free to [1185.44] pause the video [1188.799] and so here is our original function [1191.44] it's 0.01 t squared [1194.72] plus 0.5 t plus 100 [1198.559] so let's go ahead and plug in zero if we [1200.72] plug in zero it's going to give us this [1202.24] value which is a hundred [1205.44] now if we plug in 9 [1213.12] it's going to give us [1214.72] 105.31 [1217.44] now let's plug in 10. [1223.76] so it's going to be 106 [1226.24] and if we plug in 11 [1235.6] we're going to get [1237.039] 106.71 [1239.52] now let's plug in 20. [1246.4] so you should get 114. [1250.32] now keep in mind t is in minutes [1253.039] and a of t is in gallons [1256.32] so let's focus on part b [1258.799] how fast is the amount of water changing [1261.76] in the tank [1262.96] when t is equal to 10. [1267.84] so do we need to find the derivative [1270.88] or do we need to integrate [1273.52] how fast is the amount of water changing [1276.48] or we're dealing with rates of change [1278.96] or accumulation [1281.84] so because we're dealing with rates of [1283.679] change [1285.2] we're dealing with derivatives [1288.72] so let's begin by finding [1290.48] the first derivative [1292.4] a prime of t [1293.84] so what is the derivative of t squared [1296.96] so using the power rule it's going to be [1298.799] 2 [1299.76] t [1300.48] to the 2 minus 1 [1302.24] which is 2t to the first power or simply [1304.64] 2t [1306.4] now what is the derivative of t [1308.96] or t to the first power [1310.88] it's going to be 1 [1312.72] t raised to the 1 minus 1 [1315.039] which is 1 t to the 0 anything raised to [1318.08] the zero power is one [1319.919] so this is going to be point five times [1321.76] one [1322.72] now what about the derivative of a [1324.24] constant like a hundred [1326.88] the derivative of any constant is zero [1329.6] if you were to use the power rule this [1331.36] would be a hundred [1333.12] and then [1335.039] times zero because you need to bring [1337.2] this to the front [1338.48] and then it's going to be t to the zero [1340.48] minus one [1341.76] a hundred times zero the whole thing is [1343.28] zero [1345.36] so therefore [1348.72] the derivative function is going to be a [1351.28] prime of t [1352.799] which is [1354.08] point zero one times two that's point [1355.919] zero two t [1357.679] plus point five [1360.559] so this is the derivative it's going to [1362.32] tell us [1363.52] how fast [1364.799] the amount of water is changing in the [1366.72] tank at any time t [1369.52] so we want to find out how fast is [1371.84] changing when t is 10. so that's 0.02 [1375.2] times 10 [1376.96] plus 0.5 [1379.12] 0.02 times 10 that's 0.2 [1382.799] and 0.2 plus 0.5 it's 0.7 [1387.6] so this tells us [1389.76] that [1390.64] the amount of water is changing [1395.44] by 0.7 [1397.28] gallons [1398.559] every minute [1399.76] when t is 10. [1405.44] now if we were to graph the original [1407.44] function [1408.799] this value [1410.159] will represent the slope [1412.0] of the tangent line [1413.6] but how do we know if our answer is [1415.039] correct well one way to determine that [1417.6] is to [1418.799] calculate the slope of the tangent line [1421.44] by approximating it using the slope of [1423.279] the secant line [1425.279] now it's important to understand that [1426.559] the slope of the tangent line represents [1428.72] the instantaneous rate of change [1431.6] it's the rate of change exactly [1434.0] when t is 10 that's at one point [1437.36] the slope of the secant line represents [1440.24] the average [1441.76] rate of change which you can calculate [1444.0] it using two points [1448.08] so to calculate the slope of the secant [1449.76] line or the average rate of change [1452.88] our two points will be 9 and 11 because [1455.52] 10 is the midpoint [1457.6] of 9 and 11. [1461.36] so remember [1462.64] to calculate the slope which is [1464.96] associated with derivatives [1467.279] you need to [1468.72] divide the y values by the x values [1472.64] so t would be along the x axis a of t [1475.2] would be along the y axis [1478.88] so a 11 is a y value and the same is [1481.679] true for a of 9. [1484.799] 11 and 9 those are x values or t values [1489.2] so at 11 [1492.0] it's [1493.08] 106.71 and at 9 it's [1496.6] 105.31 [1498.4] 11 minus 9 is 2. [1501.279] so if we were to plug this in [1503.6] to the calculator [1508.48] this will give us 0.7 [1512.32] and so in this case the slope of the [1514.48] secant line is the same as the slope of [1517.52] the tangent line [1521.36] now another way in which you could see [1522.88] the answer [1524.559] is by looking [1526.08] at the table [1528.799] so remember this is [1531.279] the amount of water that changes every [1533.2] minute so 0.7 gallons per minute tells [1536.08] us that [1536.96] every minute the amount of water in the [1539.44] tank is increasing by 0.7 gallons [1542.799] and so looking at the table going from 9 [1545.36] minutes to 10 minutes [1546.96] in one minute the increase in the amount [1549.44] of water was 0.69 gallons [1553.36] and going from 10 to 11 or the next [1555.84] minute the increase in the amount of [1557.76] water [1560.48] is 0.71 [1562.72] gallons [1563.84] so if we were to average [1566.799] the changes from 9 to 10 and 10 to 11 it [1569.919] will give us 0.7 gallons per minute [1573.679] and so hopefully this example [1575.84] illustrates [1577.039] how derivatives can be used [1579.44] to calculate [1581.44] an instantaneous rate of change it can [1583.44] tell you how fast something is changing [1586.08] per unit of time [1588.559] now let's work on this problem [1590.72] the rate of water flowing in a tank [1593.2] can be represented by the function r of [1595.44] t [1596.24] which is equal to 0.5 t plus 20 [1599.76] where r of t [1601.52] represents the number of gallons of [1603.279] water flowing per minute [1605.12] and t [1606.32] is the time in minutes [1608.08] so here's the question [1610.24] how much water will accumulate [1613.76] in the tank from t equals 20 to t equals [1616.159] 100 minutes [1619.2] so should we use integration or [1621.52] differentiation [1623.44] remember derivatives will help you to [1625.36] find the rate at which something is [1627.919] changing [1629.12] but integration is the process by which [1631.76] you can determine how much something [1634.0] accumulates over time [1636.32] and so this is an integration problem [1640.48] now we can calculate [1642.24] the net change in the volume of water [1646.72] using a definite integral [1648.799] from a to b [1650.48] of the function r of t [1652.399] dt [1654.32] the difference between a definite [1655.76] integral and an indefinite integral [1658.799] is that [1660.24] a definite integral have the lower limit [1662.799] and the upper limit and it gives you a [1665.2] number [1667.12] whereas the indefinite integral which is [1668.96] on the bottom this gives you a function [1672.0] it doesn't give you a number [1674.559] so make sure you understand that key [1676.08] difference between definite integrals [1678.559] and indefinite integrals [1681.279] so going back to this problem [1684.399] to calculate how much water will [1686.0] accumulate in the tank [1687.84] in those 80 minutes [1689.679] we can see that a is 20 that's the lower [1692.08] limit [1693.279] b is a hundred [1696.159] r of t is point five t [1700.08] plus twenty [1703.52] so let's go ahead and find the [1705.2] anti-derivative of point five t and [1707.2] twenty [1708.399] so the anti-derivative of t to the first [1710.48] power [1711.44] is going to be t to the second power [1713.84] divided by two [1715.279] just add one to the exponent and then [1717.52] divide by that result [1720.399] now for 20 [1722.399] you can imagine 20 as being 20 t to zero [1725.6] so if you add one to zero you'll get one [1727.919] and then divide by that number [1730.559] and then we're going to evaluate the [1732.159] result from 20 to 100 [1740.88] so the first thing we're going to do [1742.96] is plug in a hundred [1745.76] so it's 0.5 [1747.76] times 100 squared [1750.08] divided by 2 plus [1752.48] 20 t or 20 times 100 [1755.6] and then [1756.72] we're going to plug in 20 into this [1758.96] expression [1760.559] so it's minus [1762.64] 0.5 times 20 squared [1765.679] divided by two [1767.2] plus [1768.64] twenty times twenty [1772.399] so now let's work out the math [1776.08] a hundred squared is ten thousand [1778.799] and ten thousand divided by two is five [1781.039] thousand [1782.0] half of five thousand [1783.679] is twenty five hundred [1786.08] and then twenty times a hundred is two [1788.0] thousand [1791.2] here we have twenty squared [1793.52] so 20 times 20 is 400 divided by 2 [1796.72] that's 200 [1798.08] and then half of 200 that's a hundred [1801.52] and here we have 20 times 20 which is [1804.0] 400 [1807.039] so now we have [1808.399] forty five hundred [1810.48] minus five hundred [1812.799] so the net change [1814.399] should be four thousand [1818.559] so from t equals twenty to t equals 80 [1822.08] the tank will gain 4 000 gallons of [1825.52] water [1827.76] earlier in this video [1829.76] we said that integration is associated [1832.399] with finding the area [1834.08] under the curve [1835.679] so what we're going to do [1838.159] is we're going to graph this function [1840.88] so the y-axis corresponds to r of t [1844.08] the x-axis is t [1847.6] now when t is 0 [1849.36] the y value will be 20. this is the y [1851.76] intercept [1853.76] now the points of interest are 20 and [1856.0] 100 [1857.44] so when t is 20 if you plug it into this [1860.32] expression [1861.519] 0.5 times 20 is 10 plus 20 that's 30. [1867.6] so we have this point [1869.44] so r of 20 is 30 and r of 0 [1873.36] let me use a different color [1875.279] is 20. [1876.72] now what about r of 100 [1879.76] so 0.5 times 100 is 50 plus 20 [1883.36] that's going to give us 70. [1885.919] so r of 100 is 70. [1888.799] and now we can draw a straight line [1892.32] so our goal [1893.76] is to calculate [1895.6] the area under the curve from 20 to 100 [1900.88] this area [1903.2] let me shade it [1905.76] represents [1907.039] the increase [1908.799] in the volume of water that's already in [1911.279] the tank [1913.039] it doesn't represent the total amount of [1915.2] water [1916.08] that's in a tank at a hundred [1918.64] it simply represents [1921.279] the change in the volume of water in [1923.84] those 80 minutes [1925.84] so let's calculate the area [1927.919] under the curve [1929.76] now using geometry it's helpful to break [1932.399] this region into a rectangle [1934.48] and a triangle [1937.039] and so to find the area we need to [1938.72] multiply the x values by the y values [1941.519] the area of a rectangle is left times [1943.519] width [1945.2] so the length is the difference between [1947.039] 120 [1948.48] which is 80. [1951.76] the unit for this is 80 minutes [1954.64] and the height [1956.24] of the rectangle is 30 [1958.88] and the unit for that is gallons per [1961.519] minute [1963.279] so if you multiply minutes [1965.2] by gallons per minute [1967.279] the unit minutes will cancel giving you [1969.279] the unit gallons [1972.08] so 80 times 30 8 times 3 is 24 and then [1976.159] if we add the two zeros [1978.0] that will give us twenty four hundred [1980.88] now let's focus on the triangle [1983.6] the area of a triangle is one half base [1985.84] times height [1987.2] in this case we could say the base [1989.44] is associated with the x-axis the height [1991.519] is associated with the y-axis [1994.24] so whenever you're dealing with [1995.6] integration you're going to be [1996.96] multiplying x by y [1999.039] when you're dealing with differentiation [2000.799] you're dividing y by x [2004.88] now the base of the triangle is still 80 [2007.6] is still the difference between 120 but [2010.159] the height of the triangle [2011.919] is the difference between 70 and 30 so [2014.72] it's 40. [2017.6] now 80 times 40 8 times 4 is 32 and if [2021.36] you add the two zeros that's 3200 [2024.08] but we need to take half of it [2026.08] because [2027.2] we no longer have a rectangle we have a [2029.44] triangle and a triangle is half of a [2031.76] rectangle [2033.44] so that's why it's a half base times [2034.96] height [2035.76] so half of 3200 is 1600 [2039.679] thus [2040.88] if we add 1600 [2044.159] and 2400 that's going to give us our [2046.799] answer of 4 000. [2049.359] and so that's how much water was [2051.359] accumulated in the tank in those 80 [2053.359] minutes [2054.399] it's 4 000 gallons of water it doesn't [2057.04] represent the total amount of water in a [2058.879] tank but it represents [2062.079] the change in the volume of the water [2065.359] in the last 80 minutes [2068.24] so that's basically it for this video [2070.8] so to review just remember limits [2073.76] allow you to evaluate a function [2077.04] when x approaches a certain value [2081.359] derivatives [2082.879] are functions [2084.879] that allow you [2086.639] to calculate the instantaneous rate of [2089.359] change of a function at any instant of [2092.159] time [2093.119] and remember the instantaneous rate of [2095.04] change [2095.919] is equivalent to the slope of the [2097.92] tangent line [2099.28] at any instant of time [2101.599] now you can approximate the slope of the [2103.92] tangent line [2105.04] using the slope of the secant line [2108.4] which is equivalent to an average rate [2110.56] of change between two points [2114.24] finally we have integration [2116.72] which is a process that allows us [2119.44] to determine [2121.04] how much something accumulates over time [2124.0] and we can [2125.28] find that value by evaluating the [2127.599] definite integral or by calculating the [2130.24] area under the curve [2133.44] so these are the three fundamental [2135.28] concepts [2136.56] taught in a typical [2138.96] calculus course [2140.56] so make sure you understand the basic [2142.16] idea behind limits derivatives and [2143.839] integration [2145.119] and that's basically it for this video [2147.119] so for those of you who haven't done so [2148.8] already [2149.92] feel free to subscribe to this channel [2153.68] and don't forget to click on that [2155.119] notification bell [2157.52] now i'm going to post some links [2159.92] in the description section of this video [2163.119] with more problems on limits [2165.44] derivatives and integration so you can [2168.16] get more practice with that and also [2170.079] check out my new calculus video playlist [2172.72] because it has specific topics in calc [2175.52] that can help you if you're taking that [2177.119] course [2178.56] so that's all i got for this video [2179.92] thanks again for watching
